# Transseptal Puncture Simulation Training
An Anthropomorphic Phantom for Atrial Transseptal Puncture Simulation Training - 3D Printing in Medicine (2024)

## Overview
This repository provides open-source access to the STL files for a novel, anatomically accurate _Anthropomorphic Phantom for Transseptal Puncture (TSP) Simulation Training_, developed to simulate patient-specific left atrial anatomy. The phantom allows for realistic simulation of the transseptal puncture procedure, commonly performed during left-sided cardiac interventions such as atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation and left atrial appendage closure. These files are intended for researchers, educators, and clinicians interested in medical simulation/training, cardiology, 3D printing, and preliminary medical device testing.

The phantom has been designed to be with multiple imaging modalities, including X-ray fluoroscopy and ultrasound, and incorporates a replaceable fossa ovalis component to facilitate repeated simulations.
